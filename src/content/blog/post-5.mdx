The commerce ministry has granted authorization to the newly established Export Promotion Council for Medical Devices (EPCMD) to issue registration-cum-membership certificates (RCMC) for exporters dealing with specific items such as bandages and first-aid boxes. These RCMCs are essential for exporters to access benefits outlined in the foreign trade policy. Additionally, holding this certificate can facilitate exporters in obtaining advantages related to customs and excise regulations.

Export promotion councils and commodity boards are responsible for issuing these certificates. In accordance with a public notice from the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT), the Export Promotion Council for Medical Devices (EPCMD) has been incorporated into the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) to enable the issuance of RCMCs specifically for designated items.

Among these items are products like hot water bottles, ice bags, gloves, personal protective garments for medical or surgical use, surgical gowns and drapes, syringes (with or without needles), and stethoscopes.

Raghuveer Kini has recently assumed the role of executive director at the council. Previously, he held positions as the executive director of the Pharmaceuticals Export Promotion Council (Pharmexcil) and Director of the Plastics Export Promotion Council (Plexconcil).
