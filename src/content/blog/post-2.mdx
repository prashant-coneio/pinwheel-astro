On Friday, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) revealed its plan to implement the limitation on importing specific laptops and computers categorized under HSN 8471, starting November 1, 2023. Following this prescribed date, the importation of laptops, computers, and associated components will be conditional upon obtaining the appropriate license.

According to the notification issued by DGFT, a grace period has been established, allowing import consignments to be processed without a license for restricted imports until October 31, 2023. Subsequent to this deadline, adherence to the licensing requirement will be obligatory for the importation of the designated laptops, computers, and related items.
