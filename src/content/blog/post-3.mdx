In an announcement made on Friday, the government has prolonged the deadline for the implementation of the track and trace system for exporting drug formulations until February of the following year. This extension encompasses drug formulations produced by both non-Small Scale Industries (non-SSI) and Small Scale Industries (SSI).

The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) released a public notice stating, "The deadline for executing the track and trace system for drug formulation exports, which involves maintaining a hierarchical packaging structure and uploading relevant data to a central portal, has been stretched until February 1, 2024. This extension pertains to drug formulations manufactured by both SSI and non-SSI entities."

It is notable that the implementation dates have been extended previously as well, reflecting a series of adjustments to the original timeline.
